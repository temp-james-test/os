# Wolfi

This is the main package repository for the Wolfi project.

Named after the [smallest octopus][wiki-ow], Wolfi is a lightweight GNU
software distribution which is designed around minimalism, making it
well-suited for containerized environments built with [apko][apko].

It is built using [melange][melange], and is sponsored by [Chainguard][cg],
which uses it to provide [lightweight GNU/Linux runtime images][cgi].

## Mixing packages with other distributions

Mixing packages with other distributions is not supported and can create security problems.

## If Wolfi is missing a package you require

Wolfi is not currently intended to be a general purpose desktop operating system. Our priority is to provide packages
that enable containerized and embedded system workflows. Please keep this in mind when proposing adding packages to
Wolfi. Also note that some packages may not be appropriately licensed for inclusion.  FSF or OSI approved [licenses](https://spdx.org/licenses/) are ideal.

To request inclusion of a package into Wolfi please use our [New Package Request Template](https://wolfi.dev/os/issues/new/choose).
